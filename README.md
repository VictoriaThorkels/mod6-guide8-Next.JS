# mod6-guide8-Next.JS

next.js-written assignment.

After talking to Smári about this project, he told me that since we had already used all the basic functionalities that come up in next.js. That I could write about rendering and frameworks to show a basic understanding.


Understand the different ways of rendering HTML and the pros and cons of each of them:
- Rendering your code is the process that turns the code you write an application in into something that users can interact with on a web page.
- Next.JS has four rendering approaches: Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and Client Side Rendering (CSR).
- Static Site and Server-Side rendering are the best rendering approaches when it comes to your SEO.
- (SEO stands for search Engine Optimization. It creates a strategy that increases your ranking position in the search engine results. And the higher the ranking, the more organic traffic your site gets, and therefor you get more business.)
- Now the reason Static Site and Server-Side rendering are better than others is because they are pre-rendered.
- (Pre-rendering means that the HTML is rendered at build time.)
- But there is a difference between Static Site and Server-Side rendering. Static Site rendering is faster but requires a lot more physical work because you need to create responses for every possible request in advance. On the other hand, Server-Side rendering is slower but less work for you because all you need to do is set up a server that does all the work for you. Then it happens on demand, as the user requests each file.

Understand what a framework is:
- A framework is the base on which you build your code, so that you are not always having to start from the beginning. 
- "They work like templates work for website designs."
- There are many different frameworks that serve different purposes and, therefore, will not suit all projects.
- Each framework offers its own toolbox for you to utilize to your liking.
- But keep in mind that there are frameworks for the back-end (like node.js) and the front-end (like react).

I hope this shows that I have a basic understanding of how rendering works and what a framework is.
